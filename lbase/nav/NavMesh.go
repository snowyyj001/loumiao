/**

@typedef dtPolyRef
@par

Polygon references are subject to the same invalidate/preserve/restore
rules that apply to #dtTileRef's.  If the #dtTileRef for the polygon's
tile changes, the polygon reference becomes invalid.

Changing a polygon's flags, area id, etc. does not impact its polygon
reference.

@typedef dtTileRef
@par

The following changes will invalidate a tile reference:

- The referenced tile has been removed from the navigation mesh.
- The navigation mesh has been initialized using a different set
  of #dtNavMeshParams.

A tile reference is preserved/restored if the tile is added to a navigation
mesh initialized with the original #dtNavMeshParams and is added at the
original reference location. (E.g. The lastRef parameter is used with
dtNavMesh::addTile.)

Basically, if the storage structure of a tile changes, its associated
tile reference changes.


@var unsigned short dtPoly::neis[DT_VERTS_PER_POLYGON]
@par

Each entry represents data for the edge starting at the vertex of the same index.
E.g. The entry at index n represents the edge data for vertex[n] to vertex[n+1].

A value of zero indicates the edge has no polygon connection. (It makes up the
border of the navigation mesh.)

The information can be extracted as follows:
@code
neighborRef = neis[n] & 0xff; // Get the neighbor polygon reference.

if (neis[n] & #DT_EX_LINK)
{
    // The edge is an external (portal) edge.
}
@endcode

@var float dtMeshHeader::bvQuantFactor
@par

This value is used for converting between world and bounding volume coordinates.
For example:
@code
const float cs = 1.0f / tile->header->bvQuantFactor;
const dtBVNode* n = &tile->bvTree[i];
if (n->i >= 0)
{
    // This is a leaf node.
    float worldMinX = tile->header->bmin[0] + n->bmin[0]*cs;
    float worldMinY = tile->header->bmin[0] + n->bmin[1]*cs;
    // Etc...
}
@endcode

@struct dtMeshTile
@par

Tiles generally only exist within the context of a dtNavMesh object.

Some tile content is optional.  For example, a tile may not contain any
off-mesh connections.  In this case the associated pointer will be null.

If a detail mesh exists it will share vertices with the base polygon mesh.
Only the vertices unique to the detail mesh will be stored in #detailVerts.

@warning Tiles returned by a dtNavMesh object are not guarenteed to be populated.
For example: The tile at a location might not have been loaded yet, or may have been removed.
In this case, pointers will be null.  So if in doubt, check the polygon count in the
tile's header to determine if a tile has polygons defined.

@var float dtOffMeshConnection::pos[6]
@par

For a properly built navigation mesh, vertex A will always be within the bounds of the mesh.
Vertex B is not required to be within the bounds of the mesh.
